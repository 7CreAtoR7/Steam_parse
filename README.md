# Steam_parse_HTML_Tags
First of all you should paste the link of the game from Steam.
The result of the code - HTML Tags, which you can put in a HTML IDE.
For example: https://jsfiddle.net/
If you "Run" it, you will see the page of the game like a shop.
This code makes a "game shop".

If you don't need HTML Tags, you can just add method: .get_text(strip=True)
After that you will get a text about the game, not HTML Tags.
