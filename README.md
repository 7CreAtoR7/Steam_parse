# Steam_parse_HTML_Tags
1.First of all you should paste the link of the game from Steam.

2.The result of the code - HTML Tags, which you can put in a HTML IDE.

3.For example: https://jsfiddle.net/

4.If you "Run" it, you will see the page of the game like a shop.

5.This code makes a "game shop".

If you don't need HTML Tags, you can just add method: .get_text(strip=True)

After that you will get a text about the game, not HTML Tags.
